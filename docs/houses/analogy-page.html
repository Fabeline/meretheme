        To make it easier to understand how MereTheme works, we have created some analogies.

        #### Garden
        The topmost page is the
        garden. It is the master controller, and contains the content that should be visible on every page. For
        instance the menu and a footer.

        #### House
        The garden has an entrance door to a house. It can only have one house at a given time.
        The house are the pages. They are the main content of the site.

        #### Path
        The path is the link to the house.

        #### Room
        A house can have mutliple rooms. They are
        small, reusable components that be shared across the houses. Like the box on the top right of this page
        explaining the
        analogies.
