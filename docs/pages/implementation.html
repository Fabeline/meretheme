            ### Reusable components

            MereTheme has a built in iframe system for handling reusable components. We avoid using JavaScript for
            rendering since most search engine crawlers do not use JavaScript when they crawl the web.

            ### SEO friendly

            To be able to meet the requirement of being a search engine optimization (SEO) friendly framework, all pages
            should be written in HTML and not rendered with JavaScript.

            MereTheme uses iframes to be able to reuse components across pages. This works nicely with SEO, but note
            that it considers the iframe as a separate website than the main site.

            #### Routing

            Each house has it's own standalone html file, and are inserted into the garden. They are accessible on your
            file system
            or a web server. If you go directly to one of the houses, you will be forwarded to the garden with the
            selected house embedded in an iframe.

            #### Menu

            We have a build in menu system where you can define links to different houses. This will
            make the search engines find your houses. If you click one of the links,
            MereTheme will intercept the click event and load the house in an iframe and give the menu item an "active"
            css class for you to style.

            #### Title
            When you load a new page in an iframe, MereTheme will fetch the
            title of the page, report it to the parent frame, and set it as the title of the main page.

            ## Accessible
            Iframes are not the best when it comes to accessibility. That is because you need to hardcode their size. To
            be truly accessible a page must for instance support different text sizes, so setting a strict size will not
            be a good idea. In MereTheme the iframs calculates the sizes the need on every resize event, and report to
            the parent page that will adjust the size.

            ## Downside
            As any loose coupled component framework, the downside is that integrations must be loaded for each
            component.
            If you are for instance using bootstrap in both the garden, house and any rooms, it will be loaded for each
            of them.
