        <p>Welcome to my little website. This page is created by my own little, frontend framework, MereTheme.</p>
        <p>The name "Fabeline" originates from when I was 15 years old and was trying to find a nickname to go by on
            the chat service IRC. I don't remember when, but I ended up registering the domain fabeline.com, and is
            still paying for it.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to connect, feel free to reach out to me on
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruth-merethe-granevang/">LinkedIn</a>.
