            ### Getting started

            To get started with MereTheme, you need to include the MereTheme JavaScript and CSS files in your HTML file.
            You can download the files from the [MereTheme GitHub repository]

            ### Analogies
            To make it easier to understand how MereTheme works, we have created some analogies.

            #### Garden
            The topmost page is the
            garden. It is the master controller, and contains the content that should be visible on every page. For
            instance the menu and a footer.

            #### House
            The garden has an entrance door to a house. It can only have one house at a given time.
            The house are the pages. They are the main content of the site.

            #### Room
            A house can have mutliple rooms. They are
            small, reusable components that be shared across the houses. Like the box on the top right of this page
            explaining the
            analogies.
